## The problem DUGUP solves

### Beyond Fan to Earn: Growing My Star Together

DUGUP goes beyond earning for fans—it's about growing together with their stars. BTS's rise to fame, powered by global fan support, showcases the power of community. It's not agency plans, but fan involvement that drives success. DUGUP ensures fan engagement directly boosts their favorite artists.
